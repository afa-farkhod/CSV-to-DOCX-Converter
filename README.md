- The code is organized in the following package `com.example.csvtodocxconverter`;
- The main class is called UI, representing the user interface of the application.
- The UI class extends the `javafx.application.Application` class, which is the base class for JavaFX applications.
- The class defines various instance variables that hold references to UI components such as the stage, file chooser, labels, buttons, and a backend object.
- The class contains constructors that initialize the instance variables and set up event handlers for the buttons.
- The `show()` method sets up the user interface layout using a vertical box (VBox) container and displays it in the application window.
- The class provides methods for importing files, both CSV files (importFile()) and images (importImage()), and displaying the selected file paths in the UI.
- The `convertToDOCX()` method converts the selected files to the DOCX format, either by utilizing the backend object's `convertToDOCX()` method or by converting image files to DOCX using Apache POI.
- The `downloadDOCX()` method allows users to download the converted DOCX files by opening them with the default system application.
- The `clearConvertedFiles()` method deletes the converted DOCX files from the system and clears the list of converted file paths.
- The `start()` method is the entry point of the JavaFX application and initializes the application window, backend object, and user interface.
- The `main()` method launches the JavaFX application.

- Demo video shows the simulation of importing several files and clear them from the local directory, lastly it shows importing image and moving it to word file:
